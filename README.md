# Photovoltaic power forecast
Photovoltaic power generation forecasting using artificial intelligence algorithms.
This is a **Final Year Project**. Using ANN and Random Forest modules to forecast power generation. Only critical codes were uploaded.
## Innovation
The highlight innovation I think is using the Fourier series to extract periodic characteristics of weather data. By adopting two fundamental angular frequencies, the method can achieve both accuracy and efficiency..
You can see the details of this method through [my blog](https://dontdrink.eu.org/2023/06/multi-cycle-periodic-function-approximation-using-fourier-series/).
## Report
